# E-Learning Platform Technical Documentation

## Project Overview
The E-Learning Platform is a comprehensive online education system designed to connect instructors with students through interactive courses. The platform supports video lectures, quizzes, progress tracking, and real-time collaboration.

## Backend Architecture

### Technology Stack
- Node.js with Express.js framework
- MongoDB for primary database
- Redis for caching and session management
- Socket.IO for real-time features

### Database Design
- **Users Collection**
  - User profiles (students/instructors)
  - Authentication data
  - Progress tracking
  - Permissions and roles

- **Courses Collection**
  - Course metadata
  - Curriculum structure
  - Learning materials
  - Assessment data

- **Interactions Collection**
  - Comments and discussions
  - Quiz responses
  - Progress markers
  - Activity logs

### Server-Side Logic
- RESTful API implementation with Express
- JWT-based authentication system
- Middleware for role-based access control
- WebSocket integration for real-time features
- Background job processing for video encoding
- API rate limiting and security measures

## Frontend Implementation

### Technology Stack
- React.js with TypeScript
- Redux for state management
- Material-UI component library
- Axios for API communication

### UI Design
- Responsive layout supporting all devices
- Dark/light theme support
